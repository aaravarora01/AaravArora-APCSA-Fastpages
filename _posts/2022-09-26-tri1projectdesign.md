# Background #
- If you need to practice or study for any test, flashcards/memorization is often the way to go
- Quizlet is now paid - we need a better alternative solution

# Quiz Me! #

## Brain Write ##
- A tool that has similar functionality to Quizlet
- Users can create an account and put in terms and definitions one-by-one
- They can add in multiple choice questions that they find online or the site can automatically create it for them
- For more complicated questions, they can create a blog post and have a peer in the class help them with an answer
- For math questions, this may include posting explanations or showing problem work
- Video Tutorial w/ Tips and Basic Instructions on Website

# Baseline Project Goals #
- Create an online tool that has flashcards and a way to test yourself in an MC format
- Users can take practice quizzes that we create beforehand or input their own data
- Meant to replace Quizlet

# Further Ideas #
- Use OCR to read written flashcards and put them on a computer
- Read data from an Excel or Google Sheet file and import it into flashcards
- Use images as flashcards for people who want to remember specific things from an image
- Make a matching game between terms and definitions
