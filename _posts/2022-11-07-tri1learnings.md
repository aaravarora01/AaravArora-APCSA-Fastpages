# Unit 1 - Primitive Types #

### Notes ###

-  Java has simple syntax
- Automatic garbage collection
- Multithreading
- Boolean, int, double, char, float, long, others
- Variable Naming: Lettrers/numbers, no special characters
- addition, subtraction, division, modulus, multiplication
- Compound operators
- Both must be attached to a variable

# Unit 2 - Using Objects #

### Notes ###

- Java is an OOP language that compartmentalizes data and functions to bound them together
- Classes are templates from which objects are created, objects are instances of classes
- Syntax for creating a class is Painter myPainter = new Painter();
- Method declaration has 6 components: access modifier, return type, method name, parameter list, exception list, method body
- Calling method: methodName(parameter1, parameter2);
- Calling object's method: objectReference.methodName(parameter1, parameter2);

# Unit 3 - Boolean/If Statements #

### Notes ###

-  Big part of AP test
- Most FRQs and MC have some if or if else statements
- Switch case
- Booleans are important
- If statement is a conditional where something runs if it's true
- If/else is similar to if but it has an option for something to happen if the if statement is not met
- If else if allows you to create many options for something to occur
- Switch statement adds efficiency and can switch the code using a control flow statement
- Boolean expressions return true or false based on the condition
- Logic Gates
- DeMorgan's Law:(not(A and B)) is equal to (not A or not B)
- (not(A or B)) is equal to (not A and not B)
- (not(A and B)) is not equal to (not A and not B)

# Unit 5 - Writing Classes #

### Notes ###

-  Essential aspect of OOP
- Models real world objects
- Object: state, attributes, behavior (instance of class)
- Represented by instance in the program 
- Class defines abstract data type, object references, instance variables
- Methods: behaviors or actions that apply to objects, constructors create the object
- Main Method tests the class, intsance variables --> attributes, fields, projects
- Constructors are a special method for object instantiation, default constructor, multiple constructors per class
- Comments can be added, preconditions for what must be true before code is implemented and postcondition about what should be true after the method is run
- Accessor and mutator methods
- 3 parts to writing methods: method definition, method signature, method body
- Method return types: string, int, boolean, object type, void
- Static modifier, this, access modifier
- Three levels of scope: class level, method level, block level
