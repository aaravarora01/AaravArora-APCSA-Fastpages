# Unit 6 - Arrays #

### Notes ###

- 6.1: how to declare arrays, mc about installation/access
- 6.2: access an array using for/while, mc about ouput of code, FRQ about traversal
- 6.3: enhanced loop structure
- 6.4: using min/max, average of data, sifting array values
- Array: type of data structure, arrays and array lists are different
- Primitive data contains single variable type
- Element is one value in an array, index is the position of the value in an array
- Common errors are bound errors or uninitialized and unfilled arrays
- Traversing an array is accessing values inside of it
- You can use iteration or loop to traverse an array
- You can use a basic for loop to see all the elements of the array
- Use an enhanced for loop to visit all elements of the array
- Developing algorithms --> identifying max/min, finding sums of arrays, sorting arrays, array.length, array[i]
