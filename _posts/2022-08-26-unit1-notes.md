## Notes

- Call System class methods to generate output to the console.
- When creating a variable, identify the most appropraite data type for a particular specification and declare variables of the correct type to represent primitive data. 
- Primitives can be used to evaluate arithmetic expressions in a program code. 
- An aassignment state can help find what is stored in a variable. 
- Arithmetic expressions can use casting.

Errors Discussion:
- A logic error is a mistake in the algorithm or program that causes it to behave incorrectly or unexpectedly.
- A syntax error is a mistake in the program where the rules of the programming  language are not followed.
- A run-time error is a mistake in the program that occurs during the execution of a program. Programming languages define their own run-time errors.
- An overflow error is an error that occurs when a computer attempts to handle a number that is outside of the defined range of values.
- The following are effective ways to find and correct errors: test cases, hand tracing, visualizations, debuggers, adding extra output statement(s)
