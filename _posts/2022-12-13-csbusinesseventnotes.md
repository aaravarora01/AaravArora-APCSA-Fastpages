# Reflection #

I learned a lot about how to properly embrace challenges and prepare myself for a career in Computer Science. The biggest takeaway I had was to keep my options open and learn as much as I can before fully committing to a field because there is a lot of job insecurity but coding is a valuable skill to hold onto. Both of the speakers have moved through many jobs and have completely different backgrounds but both agreed that coding skills can be applied in many areas and in the end the most important factor is preserving learning and gaining experiences in the most valuable areas for future jobs. I know that there will be a lot of challenges, just like there are challenges in high school but I need to do my best to prepare myself for the roadblocks that are ahead in my life.
