### Event Description
**Panel:** Colin, Anthony, Andrew, Mabel, Allison, Nitya
**Date: 08/29/2022**

### Getting Started and Staying with CS: 
- Everyone faces issues, keep persevering especially at the start
- Don’t get worried or caught up with what others are doing
- Biggest challenges as a programmer include people not putting in full effort or easily losing motivation, just keep working hard and don’t cut corners
- Having mindset to go above and beyond smalls many problems in the long term
- UCSD has some PBL projects and some individual projects
- Programming helps with all assignments and is useful even if you don’t major in CS
- Matlab or other mathematical libraries are very useful
- CS is always present in math and other majors
- Have a resume prepared and try to go above and beyond, stand out to teachers at colleges
- Separate yourself and reference how you make yourself different from others

### PBL Information:
- Will have to use Scrum Methodologies, Agile Flow
- Colleges have PBL and tests
- Some styles of project based learning work for some people
 
### Interning:
- Most interns don’t know much entering their work, you learn a lot in internships
- Lots of problem solving logic learnt from CS applies to aspects of life
- Technical revisions, wiring diagrams at NG
- Code Ninjas offers jobs as well
- Internships involve lots of scripting 
- Worked on web apps


### Final Takeaways:
- Stick with computer science and keep persevering
- Jobs are promising in CS careers and whether or not you choose to pursue it as a career or major, knowledge of CS will always be applied and help you 
- Ask for help when you need to, don’t be afraid to make mistakes and grow when you are working
- Your peers and teacher can help guide you and you should really make sure you are learning and getting the proper takeaways from lesson
- Take computer science seriously and it’ll take you over
- Work on personal project, pursue your own opportunities because they look great on a resume (graph theory, data visualization)

### My Thoughts:
I really enjoyed the lesson. I'm very interested in the field of Computer Science and I think it'd be a great opportunity to pursue in the future. Since I am just getting started with AP CSA, I think that it's definitely difficult but I have been able to apply my previous knowledge to what I'm working on and I'm confident that what I learn in this class will apply to anything I do later on in life even if it doesn't directly pertain to Computer Science. I was inspired by the panel members to perservere and stick with things in the class and I am confident that I can learn a lot throughout this entire class. I have a better understanding of what I would want to pursue in the future and I am really glad that I got to learn from the panel members. I have ideas for a possible personal project that I'd want to pursue and I am further inspired to work towards it because of the panel session today.
