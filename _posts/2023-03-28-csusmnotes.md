## Notes ##

- First generation students
- Both had tough times in high school and college but still found success in later life
- John: from San Diego, went to Palomar College, took 6 years to get a master's degree
- Computer science has applicability to other parts of life and other things you work on 
- Talks of creating a new science building for CS/Science at CSUSM
- Pathways in Physics, Biological Sciences, Mathematics, Electrical Engineering, and Biotechnology
- Cybersecurity program is new and you can get a master's in that 
- Lots of professors who you can contact, many opportunities in clubs and hackathons
- Internship opportunities which you can find through clubs, campus events, Google, get opportunities by emailing others
- Avoid unpaid internships, apply even if you feel underqualified, ask faculty members for help with applications, go to the writing center on campus for help with application essays
- Internship applications are very important
- CSUSM Programs: Summer Scholars Program, Quantum Bridge Program, Chemistry and Biochemistry Targeted Learning Community Program

## Reflection ##
I liked this session in particular because it was interesting to see how two students went from struggling in high school to doing so well in the real world because they found interest and opportunities in what they pursued in college. I learned a lot about new opportunities that I can pursue outside of school, which can help me both in high school and in the future when I'm trying to center in on what I'm interested in. Hearing from two students who have been through the entire process of finding new opportunities and struggling through them, but still reaching success at the end was encouraging and inspired me to continue pursuing what I enjoy, even if I struggle while doing it. The advice on new pathways to pursue that can connect to computer science was interesting and I'm looking more into a career path where I can apply my computer science background with knowledge I have from other classes. The mention of a cybersecurity program was something interesting for me and I want to look into CSUSM's program for cybersecurity because it's interesting to see how the extracurricular activities and classes I've taken at school can translate into a future career path for me, even if I don't realize it right now. My biggest takeaway was to be open-minded and ready for new opportunities in the future because it will only help me as I start working in the future.
