### Notes from the Video w/ Feedback ###

- Well being and mental health on college campuses is often at risk, but it matters
- Many students find themselves being too stressed to enjoy out on school and the memories they make
- Reading books for pleasure can help
- Students are missing out on the fantastic education because they're too stressed during it
- People with better well-beings are more likely to be successful
- It's important to treat yourself to something nice to keep yourself happy
- Write notes of gratitude to someone or something you're thankful for
- We need to spend more times thinking about our health and caring for ourself
- Exercise helps health as well
- We want to be good people and do stuff that we enjoy, not that we're forced to do

I enjoyed the video and thought that Professor Santos spoke well about ways that we can improve our lives. I think it would've been interesting if she had examples of how that worked out for students at a separate university and evidence of these techniques helping other students improve their well-being.
