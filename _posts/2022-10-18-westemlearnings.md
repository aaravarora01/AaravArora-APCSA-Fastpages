# Reflection #
I learned valuable experiences for my goals when I pursue an internship or career in the future. I learned a valuable lesson that we should always stay curious and take opportunities to be leaders. More often than not we can always learn from others and gain information on approaches that other people take in parts of life so if we are constantly trying to learn from others and gain knowledge that others can share with us, we are bound to be successful. I also learned important values on taking charge and leading when we should step in. Opportunities come and go so it's up to us to fully take advantage of them.
