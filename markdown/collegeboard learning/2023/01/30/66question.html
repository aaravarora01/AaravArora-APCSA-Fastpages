<p>Time: ~80 minutes</p>

<p><strong>Score: 60/66 = 0.91/1</strong></p>

<p>I scored 60/66 on this exam which I think is a good score and I know what specific areas I need to work on throughout the year. I think that I have a good understanding of most areas but need a bit more review with recursion and reviewing boolean/De Morgan’s Laws. These are areas where I plan to do more practice MCs and study more in the future.</p>

<h3 id="question-44">
<a class="anchor" href="#question-44" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Question 44</h3>

<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/45216129/215659408-72174b3d-8ce5-4616-8c5b-a92798c61641.png" alt="image"></p>

<p>I chose answer C which was incorrect. This question was actually answer D since the variables n1 and n2 are not instance variables of the Points class, nor are they defined in the incrementPoints method. The instance variables num1 and num2 should have been used instead of n1 and n2.</p>

<h3 id="question-53">
<a class="anchor" href="#question-53" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Question 53</h3>

<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/45216129/215659707-87e4f1b3-ddef-4875-88f3-db643ad5b705.png" alt="image"></p>

<p>The correct answer is that the variable total should be initiated to 1 because the first code segment acts according to that. Thus, the second code segment would return values that are as if total is one less than expected since it is initialized incorrectly.</p>

<h3 id="question-54">
<a class="anchor" href="#question-54" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Question 54</h3>

<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/45216129/215665751-a6657dd2-9a47-4291-9e57-d116734fae26.png" alt="image"></p>

<p>I chose answer C which is incorrect since this method call returns false because the first character is lexicographically less than the second character of the string. The correct answer is D.</p>

<h3 id="question-63">
<a class="anchor" href="#question-63" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Question 63</h3>

<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/45216129/215666086-a7a2806f-a391-42f2-86d8-b9f811b985d4.png" alt="image"></p>

<p>I chose answer A which is incorrect. I guessed on this question because I was unsure. However, the correct answer is C since line 5 modifies an element of arr1 if that element is smaller than the corresponding element of minArray, which is NOT what is intended, since arr1 should remain unchanged.</p>

<h3 id="question-66">
<a class="anchor" href="#question-66" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Question 66</h3>

<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/45216129/215666610-ad062d5e-6a60-4255-a755-34bb5cfe69f0.png" alt="image"></p>

<p>I chose answer D which is incorrect since the first code segment is iterating while j is less than 10, whereas the answer I chose is for when j is greater than or equal to 10, which is why it was incorrect. The correct answer was actually B since in the given for loop, j is initially 1 and increases by 2 repeatedly as long as it is less than 10. In this while loop, j is initially 1 and increases by 2 repeatedly while it is less than 10. Both code segments produce the output 13579.</p>
