<ul>
  <li>Well being and mental health on college campuses is often at risk, but it matters</li>
  <li>Many students find themselves being too stressed to enjoy out on school and the memories they make</li>
  <li>Reading books for pleasure can help</li>
  <li>Students are missing out on the fantastic education because they’re too stressed during it</li>
  <li>People with better well-beings are more likely to be successful</li>
  <li>It’s important to treat yourself to something nice to keep yourself happy</li>
  <li>Write notes of gratitude to someone or something you’re thankful for</li>
  <li>We need to spend more times thinking about our health and caring for ourself</li>
  <li>Exercise helps health as well</li>
  <li>We want to be good people and do stuff that we enjoy, not that we’re forced to do</li>
</ul>

<p>I enjoyed the video and thought that Professor Santos spoke well about ways that we can improve our lives. I think it would’ve been interesting if she had examples of how that worked out for students at a separate university and evidence of these techniques helping other students improve their well-being.</p>
