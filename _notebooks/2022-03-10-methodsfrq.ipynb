    "The FRQ answer relies on multiple data types, since we are either using strings or array lists to store multiple Strings. We know that we have to use strings since all of the music titles are in letters and we can store all of them in multiple strings. When using for loops, it's easier to iterate through each item in the array list using a for loop to then put into an if loop that can check for the required conditions."
